# pdftypist


A simple tool for practising typing skill while reading paper. 


I love gtypist, which is quite direct and helpful. But when typing with the designed process, I just had an idea:

Can we do the typing and read the paper at the same time? 

And it is the birth of pdftypist.  

en... Maybe we still need a codetypist?  :p

Have fun!


You need install ranger (a python based commandline file brower) and gtypist (a typing practising tool)  by 

```
sudo apt install ranger
sudo apt install gtypist

```

It is a trival tool, which generates gtypist format .typ from pdf, calls gtypist to do the work, then deletes the typ file.
